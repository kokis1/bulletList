This is a simple terminal application that will implement my version of the bullet list.

Bullet lists are my way of organising my week, essentially a queue structure of all my upcoming tasks.
This works better than a timetable because it only focuses on what to do next, not when to do it.
The app is very simple, each task is appended to the end of the queue by default, with each task having three attributes:
   - description: what the task is.
   - due date: when the task has to be completed by
   - tag: a classification system to group tasks together e.g coursework or job applications.
Tasks can be reordered and also viewed in order from most to least urgent.
In this way overdue tasks are flagged and displayed on the top.
